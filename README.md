# Derekstrap

An SCSS base layout and styles library by Evans Hunt.

## Requirements

This library uses `@forward` and `@use` keywords only available in [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass). It will not compile with Node Sass. [Fibers](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers) should be included as well to improve compile speed.

## Usage

`@import` '~@evanshunt/derekstrap/index' to make use of the entire library or pull in individual files to pick and choose the pieces you want.

To override any variables defined in the library simply `@import` your own variables with the same name prior to importing the library.

## Examples

Big ol' @TODO here....

## Gotchas

This library is in active development. Pull in a particular commit or tag, or coordinate with Dave if you'd like to use it in your project as it may be subject to change.
